# Gunfight
A fast-paced deathmatch mode for Hideous Destructor. Heavily inspired by the same mode in Modern Warfare 2019, the idea is to negate the problem of the "loadout meta" in Hideous Destructor deathmatch, by giving all players identical randomized equipment for each round.

Expect to die fast, and often.

## Running
Launch a multiplayer deathmatch game of GZDoom with Hideous Destructor loaded first, and Gunfight second.

### Suggested launch options:
```
-fraglimit 100 -nomonsters +set sv_samelevel true +set sv_spawnfarthest true
```
